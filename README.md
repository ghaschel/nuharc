My tribute to an old file compressor ðŸ¤“

> A blast from the past - *Said no one*

This is a cli for [node-uharc](https://github.com/ghaschel/node-uharc) with the purpose of bringing [uharc](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Fde.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FUHARC) to unix plattform as well.

#### Notice: this is pretty experimental.

Uharc was a file compression for windows only. It uses Wine for compability with Unix systems.
- Ubuntu and apt-get systems: will ask for sudo so that it can install Wine. You can check the install script [here](https://github.com/ghaschel/node-uharc/blob/master/scripts/linux-install.sh).
- MacOS: it uses homebrew to install wine, and by default no Homebres package ask for sudo. But apparently for a issue with brew in High Sierra it needs to re-gain ownership of the downloaded files. You can check the install script [here](https://github.com/ghaschel/node-uharc/blob/master/scripts/mac-install.sh).

### Installation:
